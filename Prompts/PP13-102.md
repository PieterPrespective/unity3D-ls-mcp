- IssueID : PP13-102
- This project is freshly setup to start developing a roslyn/ Language Server Protocol (LSP) mcp server for use with Unity3D Projects - for context deeply investigate the following documents
	- "Documentation\tdd\Unity-CSharp-LSP-MCP-Honest-Report.md" - 
		- Note: this document is quite long, so you might wont to investigate in chunks
		- The base premise for setting up this project, currently no MCP server seems to offer the desired functionalities for LSP for use with unity3D
		- As mentioned in the document - starting with a fork of dotnet-roslyn-mcp would be a good start - this project is that
	- The current project source we'll be working with in the folder 'src'
	- Contents of 'Examples\UMCP\Editor\Tools\ManageScripts'
		- These are tools in a previous MCP server I build for getting roslyn integration in Unity3D; arguably it may point to valuable settings for developing this project
		- this code used to live within a unity3D Project (Editor specific assembly)
		- The libraries it used are found in 'Examples\Unity-Roslyn'
- Please create a detailed plan for developing and testing this project - if any details are missing please request them - output the plan into 'Documentation\tdd\DevRoadmap.md'
	- Include a namespace rename to ULSM
	- Include setup of a specific testing project ULSM; if a Unity3D project and/or files are required for said (integration) testing please include them in the plan
	- The tools we're looking for primarily are outlined in Unity-CSharp-LSP-MCP-Honest-Report.md
